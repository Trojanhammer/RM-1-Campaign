## JavaScript Interactions

### Color Change Button
A "Change Color" button has been added to dynamically change the background color of the main section to a random color when clicked.

### Form Visibility Toggle
The donation form is initially hidden and becomes visible when the "Donate" button is clicked. Clicking the "Donate" button again toggles the form's visibility.
